        <p>“scripts” is what supports built-in scripts, such as the once used above.
            That runs the script which has nodemon run the code, and its being run on PORT 8081.
            Scripts can also be executed by running “npm run <...>”.

        <p>Dependencies are specified in a simple object that maps a package name to a version range. 
            The version range is a string which has one or more space-separated descriptors.

    <div>
        <p>Style tag in HTML I would say is fine for smaller projects. Projects that are not gonna take more than a day or two. Because when the project is getting bigger than that, you would want your css separated from your html for the simplicity of the code.
            Therefore you would make css files for given pages.
