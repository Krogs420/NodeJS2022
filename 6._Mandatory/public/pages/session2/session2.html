        <p>Having clean code should always be a standard, for everyone's sake. Having a clean code makes it easier to maintain, identify bugs / issues, 
            to come back to your code and understand what you wrote and for others to look at your code and understand the code.

            <p>THere data is being sent with a get request, where a pokemon name is requested for the battlePage. 
                The pokemon name are then injected into battlePage, so a response can be made on battlePage</p>

            <p>Normally functions must be in scope when they are called, but that changes with hoisting. 
                Because when a function is hoisted it can appear below the call in the code. 
                But it only works with declarations not with expressions.</p>

            <p>Here an arrow function is being used, with an arrow function the keyword ‘function’ is removed because it is assumed. 
                When the function has no name it does not have to be assigned to a variable, 
                it can just be defined without having to use the function keyword.</p>
