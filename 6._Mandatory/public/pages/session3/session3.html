        <p>As projects are getting bigger, using modules can be a very good way to have everything sorted a bit. Modules
            are files that can have functions or classes etc. You can then access these files with express. This will
            help organize different parts of the project better.
            As shown express is imported using import and from. To import a module you would use the ES import which is
            a syntax for importing modules
