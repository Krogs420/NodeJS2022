        <p>Mostly the git that I have used are the add - commit - push commands.
            Its used to get the code that is being worked on, put into a repository that can contain the code so it can
            be shared with others.
        <div>
            <p>This takes all the lines through the project and stages the changes
                git add -A</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Then the changes have to be committed, which saves the changes locally on your computer.
                git commit -m “message”</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>When pushed to changes will be saved at the assigned repository
                git push</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Data types describe the different types or kinds of data and their attributes, that can be stored in
                variables.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Here is an example, where two strings have been made with the value 1.10 and 2.30.
                This is then converted to a Number and added together and printed with two decimals.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Node.js is based on JavaScript, and is a JavaScript runtime environment. 
                It has all the tools needed to run a program written in JavaScript.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>When running a file in the terminal you would put ‘node app.js’ for example, 
                and that would execute the file and run the program.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Neat extension that goes amazing with node is nodemon, 
                which runs the code for you every time you make a change to it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>To get started you would run ‘npm init --y’ in the terminal to get your package.json file and node_modules, 
                which will give you context for installing packages that can be used in node like express.</p>
