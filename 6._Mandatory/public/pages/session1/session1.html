        <p>Mostly the git that I have used are the add - commit - push commands. Its used to get the code that is being worked on, put into a repository that can contain the code so it can be shared with others.

            This takes all the lines through the project and stages the changes
            git add -A
            
            Then the changes have to be committed, which saves the changes locally on your computer.
            git commit -m “message”
            
            When pushed to changes will be saved at the assigned repository
            git push
            
            
            Data types describe the different types or kinds of data and their attributes, that can be stored in variables. 
            
            Here is an example, where two strings have been made with the value 1.10 and 2.30.
            This is then converted to a Number and added together and printed with two decimals.
